India's postcode data is publicly available on the opendata website:

First, I am going to select New Delhi's postcodes, and retrieve geolocation information about them using GeoPy 
Then, I am going to query the locations in Foursquare to retrieve information on
Hospitals (4bf58dd8d48988d196941735) These venue categories are available on Foursquare 
Once I have list of locations, I can visualize them on a map by overlaying markers corresponding to each hospital.
The result will allow visualization of distribution and density of different types of hospitals.
