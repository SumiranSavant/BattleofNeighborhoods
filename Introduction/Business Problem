New Delhi is the capital of the worlds most populated country, India with a population of 29.596 million.
The number of people who are unable to afford quality healthcare is extremely large. Most citizens are below the poverty line and hence 
struggle to find healthcare services that are not expensive and are beneficial at the same time.
The goal of this project is to provide the stakeholders of New Delhi with the necessary information for decision making regarding 
planning new public hospitals within the city. Here the consultation charges will be subsidised so as to provide healthcare to everyone
